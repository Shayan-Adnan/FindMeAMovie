# FindMeAMovie
Find Me A Movie is a web application that helps users quickly discover movies based on their preferences. Whether you're looking for a specific genre, runtime, or streaming availability, it makes movie selection easy and hassle-free.

This app was made using React and Tailwind CSS and is powered by TMDB API. 

I have plans to add a LOT more features to this app in the future. Currently, it contains the following features:

## ðŸš€ Features
- Search for movies using custom filters
- Select from multiple genres, languages, runtime, and eras
- "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature for quick recommendations
- Modern UI with a clean, responsive design
- Powered by TMDB API for accurate and up-to-date movie data
- Built to be scalable, allowing new features and options to be added easily

## ðŸ“¥ Installation & Setup

**2. Install Dependencies**

**3. Add Your TMDB API Key**
